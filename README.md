# MQT QCEC - A tool for Quantum Circuit Equivalence Checking

A tool for quantum circuit equivalence checking developed as part of the [_Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT)_](https://mqt.readthedocs.io).
It builds upon [MQT Core](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/core), which forms the backbone of the MQT.

## Getting Started

MQT QCEC is available via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mqt.qcec/) for Linux, macOS, and Windows and supports Python 3.9 to 3.14.

```console
(venv) $ pip install mqt.qcec
```

The following code gives an example on the usage:

```python3
from mqt import qcec

# verify the equivalence of two circuits provided as qasm files
result = qcec.verify("circ1.qasm", "circ2.qasm")

# print the result
print(result.equivalence)
```

**Detailed documentation on all available methods, options, and input formats is available at [ReadTheDocs](https://mqt.readthedocs.io/projects/qcec).**

## System Requirements and Building

The implementation is compatible with any C++20 compiler, a minimum CMake version of 3.24, and Python 3.9+.
Please refer to the [documentation](https://mqt.readthedocs.io/projects/qcec) on how to build the project.

Building (and running) is continuously tested under Linux, macOS, and Windows using the [latest available system versions for GitHub Actions](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments).
